      I am a 2nd-year BTech IT student passionate about building innovative tech solutions.
      I have completed front-end development, Python programming, and data structures & algorithms in Java.
      Currently diving into full-stack web development and AI/ML to broaden my skill set.

      I have built web projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      I aim to apply my growing technical skills to internships and real-world problem-solving
      through collaborative projects and learning opportunities.
