        <h3>1.TIC-TAC-TOE</h3>
        <p>I developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of game logic, DOM manipulation, creating a responsive and interactive UI. Two players can take turns, and the game automatically detects a win or draw, with an option to restart. </p>
        <h3>2.Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
        <p>I created a simple yet engaging Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this game, the player selects rock, paper or scissors, and the computer randomly generates its choice. The winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game and displayed instantly. This project allowed me to practic contional logic and event handling</p>
        <h3>3.Weather Forecast Website</h3>
        <p>I built a responsive Weather Website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which fetches real-time weather data using a public weather API. Users can enter any city name to instantly view the current temperature, weather condition and location details. This project helped me gain hands-pn experience with API integration, asynchronous JavaScript and building dynamic web application.</p>
